Results are benchmarked against global averages to provide performance context. (<a data-markup=\"external\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about?hl=en\">PageSpeed Insights</a>, <a data-markup=\"external\" href=\"https://httparchive.org/\">HTTP Archive</a>)\n\n* **Sustainability (Clean):** Focuses on the ecological balance of the website. The carbon footprint is calculated based on data volume and the energy mix of the hosting data center. Additionally, the server location is identified via IP lookup.

The goal is to ensure technical accessibility for people with disabilities and the general findability of information. (<a data-markup=\"external\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about?hl=en\">PageSpeed Insights</a>)\n\n* **Security (Safe):** The rating is composed of infrastructure reputation and implemented security features. While reputation is checked against blacklists, SSL certificates and Content Security Policies (CSP) are analyzed through a proprietary logic. (<a data-markup=\"external\" href=\"https://www.abuseipdb.com/\">AbuseIPDB</a>, <a data-markup=\"external\" href=\"https://docs.cloud.google.com/web-risk/docs/reference/rest\">Google Web Risk API</a>, <a data-markup='external' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory/docs/tests_and_scoring'>HTTP Observatory Scoring Methodology</a>)\n\nThe four areas are not isolated metrics; they reinforce each other. **Efficient** programming directly reduces energy consumption through smaller data volumes (**Clean**). Simultaneously, lean code improves loading times, boosting both accessibility and visibility (**Open**).\n\nSimilarly, robust security standards (**Safe**) increase infrastructure reliability, while a clean technical foundation ensures maintainability and long-term sustainability. The ECOS audit demonstrates that optimizations in one area usually have positive ripple effects throughout the entire system."
