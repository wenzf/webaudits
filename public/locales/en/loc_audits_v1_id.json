Additionally, relative benchmarking is performed: transferred data volume and the number of server requests are put in relation to current average values from the HTTP Archive database. This accurately measures how efficiently the site performs compared to global web standards.\n\nEfficiency here not only reduces CPU load but directly improves the user experience.",
        "asd_performance": "The Performance score evaluates the speed at which content is loaded and becomes interactive. It analyzes metrics such as the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and responsiveness. High performance saves time and conserves the hardware resources of users.",

The focus is on the CO2 balance resulting from hosting and data transfer.\n\nThe calculation is performed using the co2.js library and considers two essential factors: the estimated energy consumption per page view and the share of renewable energy in the power grid of the respective server location (Grid Intensity).\n\nA high score shows that the website is operated with minimal CO2 emissions and relies on environmentally friendly infrastructure. This makes the invisible environmental impacts of digital products transparent and evaluable.",
        "asd_open": "The Open category evaluates how accessible and discoverable a website is for both humans and machines. Transparent structures and open standards are the decisive criteria here.\n\nThe score consists of two central Lighthouse audits: Accessibility and SEO. A high value guarantees that content is fully usable for people with disabilities and that technical hurdles do not hinder visibility in search engines.\n\nOpenness thus promotes an inclusive internet and ensures that information remains equally accessible to every user group.",

It combines infrastructure analysis from **AbuseIPDB** and **Google Web Risk** to detect malware or blacklisting with an in-depth audit of HTTP security headers via the **MDN HTTP Observatory**.

Since these metrics are a key ranking factor for Google, they show immediately how the website performs in the everyday life of visitors.\n\nThe analysis is carried out on two levels to evaluate both the specific subpage and the quality of the entire domain (Origin).",
